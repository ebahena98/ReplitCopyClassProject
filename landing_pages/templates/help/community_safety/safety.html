    <div class="content">
        <p>
            When you’re meeting with a buyer or seller in person, it’s important to take 
            sensible precautions to stay safe and avoid scams. Here are some tips to help 
            you have a positive MeetUp experience.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Suggest a MeetUp location</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re ready to meet in person, you’ll need to pick a location where you feel 
            safe to conduct the transaction. However, we understand that these options may not work for everyone. 
            If you’re meeting at an unofficial location, just make sure to choose a public place with lots 
            of people, good lighting, and camera surveillance if possible. For your safety, we don’t recommend 
            meeting at your home, but instead finding a neutral location to conduct your trades.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Meet during normal business hours</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever you can, schedule your MeetUps to take place during regular business hours, preferably in daylight. 
            Most Community MeetUp Spots are situated in front of local businesses or police stations. When they’re open 
            for business, they tend to get more foot traffic and provide a safe place to seek shelter if needed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Beware last-minute requests to relocate</h2>
        <p>
            When you agree on a MeetUp Spot, be cautious of last-minute requests to change the meeting location. 
            This is a tactic that scammers use to lure people to unsafe locations. For example, the other person 
            may message you 5 minutes before your MeetUp to say they’re having car trouble. Then, they’ll ask you 
            to come to a new location. To protect yourself from these types of scams, always decline last-minute 
            requests to relocate or to follow someone to a different location.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Don’t go to a MeetUp if it doesn’t feel right</h2>
        <p>
            Most importantly, if something feels off, trust your instincts. Don’t meet if it doesn’t feel safe. 
            If you’re interacting with someone suspicious, help protect our community by reporting them to.
