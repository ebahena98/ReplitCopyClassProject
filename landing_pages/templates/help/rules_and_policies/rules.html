    <h1 class="safety-title">Posting rules</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            To help make the buying and selling experience enjoyable for everyone, 
            all users are expected to follow these rules when posting items.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            Users are expected to strictly adhere to the following expectations:
            <li>Use your true identity and honestly represent yourself in your user account and in all communications with other users.</li>
            <li>Represent yourself in a respectful way when creating your account and custom profile link. </li>
            <li>Have one account per user or business (not multiple accounts per user or business).</li>
            <li>Don’t create accounts designed to impersonate someone else.</li>
            <li>Don’t use a throw-away email address. This signals to us that you might not be here for the right reasons and we will consider this fraudulent behavior.</li>
            <li>Don’t use emulators or third-party sites to post on OfferUp.</li> 
            <li>You must be the owner of your item.</li>
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Images</h2>
        <p>
            To allow buyers to get a true feel for the items you’re selling, users are expected 
            to only post images that meet these guidelines:
            <li>Always include an image of the item. Listings with no image, including those with an image that contains only text, aren't allowed.</li>
            <li>Include high-quality, well-lit images.</li>
            <li>Keep images clean by not adding extra stickers or text.</li>
            <li>Post an image of the actual item, not a catalog or stock photo.</li>
            <li>Use your own images. Don't use images that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
            <li>Keep NSFW images off the platform</li>
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Duplicate posts</h2>
        <p>
            Multiple posts showing identical items from the same seller can be confusing to buyers, and difficult to manage for sellers. 
            Even if you have more than one of the same item, please list one at a time. Don't post the same item in more than one listing 
            or in multiple categories.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Prohibited items</h2>
        <p>
            This platform is only designed for the use of selling and buying foods. Other various products that are unrelated to 
            food are not allowed to be sold on the ToroGrub platform.
